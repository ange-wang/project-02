## Project Proposal
Using Shark Attack data as the base dataset, we want to determine if there are any correlations that can be drawn from shark attacks that have occurred in the past. Correlations that we are interested in looking into include:
- Weather patterns (e.g. tidal patterns)
- Popularity of beaches
- Marine traffic

## Data Sources:
- Main dataset of shark attacks: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm.
- Scraping PDF summaries of each attack from: http://sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/pdf_directory/.
- Historic weather data from: https://openweathermap.org/history.
- Extracting popular times of beaches from Google Maps.

## Visualisation of Data:
- Geographic heatmap of where most attacks occur, toggling on and off which attacks are fatal (https://observablehq.com/@d3/geotiff-contours-ii or https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-map).
- Calendar view of all the attacks (https://observablehq.com/@d3/calendar-view)
- Sunburst chart of attacks and breaking down the region and shark breed (https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-sunburst)
- Map to show tidal patterns potentially.
